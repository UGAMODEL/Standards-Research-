[50 mm] gage length (for example, 0.5 % extension) or an offset of 0.2 % shall be taken as the yield stress, which shall be converted to yield strength by dividing by the original cross-sectional area of the gage length found in accordance with 7.3.2. It shall be reported to the nearest 100 psi [MPa]. In referee work, yield strength shall be determined as the stress that produces an extension under load of 0.5 % of the gage length.\n",
